To create an script in your computer follow the below steps:

Run windows powershell as 'Administrator'.

Once the powershell is up follow the instruction for choco installation.
Once choco is installed then crate any PS script by giving it any name (my case igave it 'automate.ps1') and
put the desired or necessary packages/softwares in the file and save it.

Once you have it just run it (C:> .\PS script) from the powershell and all the softwares will be installed one by one.


If you would like to uninstall any softwares/packages just run 'choco uninstall  'xxx(packge/software name)' and
it will be uninstalled.
